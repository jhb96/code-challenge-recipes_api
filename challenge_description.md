# Problem to resolve: Gota, an API for recipes.
We want to create a (REST) API that can manage recipes that supports these operations:

- Create a new recipe.
- Retrieve a recipe.
- Modify a recipe.

Also, we want a diagram and brief explanation of how this will run and be deployed on a Cloud Platform (e.g. AWS).

Optionally, you can:

- Add some kind of authentication (e.g. token).
- Create a lightweight client to query the API.
- Use Docker to containerize your lambda function.


## Deliverable
You should share with us a private Git repository that contains:

- Instructions on how to run your solution (README).
- A document (in the format that you prefer) with the diagram and explanation of how to deploy and run your solution in the cloud.
- Optional: Provide a containerized solution (e.g. Dockerfile).


## Considerations

- Programming Languages: Python or Go are recommended.
- You can choose what Schema definitions and data structures to use.
- You can choose any no-relational storage/persistence that you consider (e.g. DynamoDB, ElasticSearch, etc)
- Standard specifications (e.g. OpenAPI) are optional but encouraged.

## Recipe Format
The recipe format is open the whatever you consider but, please think about things such as:

- A recipe has a list of ingredients and ingredients have quantities (e.g. 50 gr of Olive Oil).
- A recipe has steps to follow.
